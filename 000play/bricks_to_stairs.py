"""
Given n amount of bricks, you have to see how many possible staircases you can
make. Every brick must be used, and every level of the staircase must be lower
than the level before it.

I spent an hour just constructing staircases on paper looking for patterns.

First, algorithm I automatically used is this:
Use all the bricks. (e.g., 9)
Use all the bricks but one (e.g. 8, 1)
Use one fewer for the highest level (e.g. 7, 2)
''   ''   ''                        (6, 3)
Now, here's where it gets interesting. There are two ways we can use 3 legally.

Because I started with 1, then 2, etc... I could always look up how many
mini-staircases could be made with the max height of current-1.

The first algorithm that makes sense to me is to do as I just did on paper, and
build all smaller staircases on the way to finding our ultimate answer. For each
number of bricks we will store the number of ways it can be built, at each maximum
height (If we have 9 bricks left, but the previous level was 6, how many ways can
we use them?)

I will build this iteratively first, although presumably we will spend time
calculating many permutations that won't exist in our actual target. I predict
that a recursive strategy (keeping a dict of previously calculated answers) will
ultimately be more efficient.

Stored data will be in a dict of dicts called perms[bricks][max_height].
e.g. perms[9][5] will store the number of stairs that can be built with 9
bricks such that the heighest level is 5 or less.
